                Initially the extent of data is reduced with changing the data types to less percise ones. Next and after developing a time-series RNN network,the relevant enegry consumption features are selected as inputs to this network. After training the model, we could reach a prediction state for the energy consumption in the production facility with only 7% error on average.

Modification of YOLOv5 model by removing unused anchors for tiny objects leads to better performance as follows; The model is 14% and 60% faster performance in comparison to respectively YOLOv5 and state-of-the-art YOLOv4-MN2 model;
                The model is lighter than models in the literature, however it (with 10.59 Mbytes) does not reach minimum parameter count and is behind YOLOv4-MN2 (7.04 Mbytes); additionally, it sacrifises 0.92% mAP for the performance speed.

                Abstract: Federated Learning and Distributed Learning were considered solutions to the problem of
                compromising private data in server-based Neural Network learning scenarios. However recent
                studies have shown, that these gradients can be inverted to reconstruct the input that produced
                them and investigated the influence of various attack- and hyperparameters on the quality of the
                reconstructions. In this paper we expand on this by analysing the influence of regularization
                techniques on the reconstructions and attack performance. We have found that Group Normalization
                and Batch Normalization have delayed gradient inversion attacks by a factor of 3 or more with variing
                degrees of influence on the training of the Neural Network. We also conclude, that high batch sizes
                seem to be benefitial for this cause. Finally, convolutional layers inside an architecture, that cannot
                be skipped have removed the ability to reconstruct details smaller than the kernel size, with only
                convolutional being completely resistent to all reconstruction attempts. We showed further, that the
                currently used metrics are not fit to assess the quality of reconstructions, especially depending on
                how much detail is needed to actually lose control of privacy on some data. However these results
                have been achieved on a particularly low resolution and easily classifiable dataset and have to be
                confirmed in higher dimensionalities and more cross-class variance.
